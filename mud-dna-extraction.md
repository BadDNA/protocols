# Summary #

Here we use a combination of diatomaceous earth and guanidine thiocyanate to purify DNA from a number of different tissue types.  This DNA extraction can be used in place of a Qiagen DNA extraction, and one should expect that this protocol yields DNA of similar quantity and quality.

## Preparation of solutions ##

### Summary ###

To prepare the main solutions needed during the MUD DNA extraction process.

### Goal ###

To prepare the main solutions needed during the MUD DNA extraction process.

### Inputs ###

1. Chemicals from above

### Outputs ###

1. Diatomaceous earth
1. Digest buffer
1. Extraction and binding buffer
1. Washing ethanol
1. [Optional] Chelex resin

### Notes ###

Carry out all procedures using DNA/PCR-free chemicals and supplies.  You may wish to autoclaves all prepared solutions, although this is not entirely necessary.  This protocol has been optimized for small skin samples (~10 mg).

### Detailed steps ###

#### Diatomaceous earth ####

This is a 1+ hour procedure.

1. Add 10 mL of water to a 50 mL conical tube.
1. Place a funnel in the top of the tube and add about 5 g of Diatomaceaous Earth
1. Fill the tube to about 45 mL with deionized water (dH2O)
1. Put the top on the tube and shake (i.e., make MUD)
1. Allow the diatoms to settle for 30-60 minutes
1. Remove the upper liquid layer (aspirate or pour off)
1. Refill to 50 mL with dH2O and mix
1. Allow to settle for 30 minutes
1. Remove the upper liquid layer (aspirate or pour off)
1. Add a volume of TE or TLE equal to the semi-solid MUD
1. Vortex vigorously immediately before using

#### Digest buffer ####

This digest buffer is 10 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 % SDS.  To prepare, combine the following in a 50 mL conical tube:

1. 1.0 mL 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0
1. 0.5 mL 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0
1. 2.0 mL 5 M NaCl
1. 40 mL dH2O 
1. 2.5 mL 10% SDS
1. dH2O to the 50 mL line of the conical


#### Binding buffer ####

This can easily be scaled up, depending on the number of DNA purifications needed.

1. Combine the following in a 50 mL conical tube:
    * 24.0 g GuSCN (guanidine isothiocyanate) [1] 
    * 22.0 mL dH2O, and 
    * 2.0 mL 1 M Tris (pH 7.5) [2]
    * 1.0 mL 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)
2. Shake and heat to 55 C to dissolve the GuSCN
3. Add 0.5 mL Triton X-100 and mix gently by inverting
4. Save the solution wrapped in aluminum foil or transfer to a brown bottle. The solution is stable for several months at room temperature.


#### Washing Ethanol ####

This is essentially 70% EtOH supplemented with 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0).  To make 500 mL mix the following in a squirt bottle (or 500 mL glass container):

1. 368.4 mL 95% EtOH 
1. 10.0 mL 5M NaCl 
1. 5.0 mL 1 M Tris, pH 8.0
1. 1.0 mL EDTA, pH 8.0
1. dH2O to 500 mL

##### Notes #####

[1] GuHCl will also work, as will other salts, but at lower efficiency.  See Rohland and Hofreiter (2007) for a huge variety of tests.  We use a slightly modified buffer containing NaCl when we have a lot of starting DNA (e.g., bird or reptile blood in lysis buffer) – see Salty_MUD_DNA_extraction protocol for details.

[2] We have used Tris pH 8.0, MOPSO pH 6.9, and MES pH 6.1 with more or less equal success over the years; any good buffer at about pH 7.0 is fine – don’t go above pH 8.0 (or the DNA yield will be bad) & don’t go too acidic (< pH 5.0) or hydrogen cyanide is produced!

#### Chelex Resin ####

1. Add 5.0 g Chelex to 50 mL conical tube
2. Fill conical tube to top with dH2O [1]
3. Shake

##### Notes #####

[1] You may wish to use ultrapure ddH2O here, and you do not want to autoclave this solution (nor can you filter sterilize it).

## Digestion of DNA-containing (animal) tissue ##

### Summary ###

We will digest animal tissue enzymatically, using Proteinase K and heat, in preparation for DNA purification.

### Goal ###

Digest tissue for DNA extraction.

### Inputs ###

1. Tissue (skin, muscle, blood, etc.) from a vertebrate organism
2. Digest buffer (from above)
3. (Shaking) Incubator set to 55 C

### Outputs ###

1. Digested tissue samples ready for DNA purification

### Detailed steps ###

1. Label a plate appropriately (barcode)
1. Place ~ 10g tissue samples in appropriate wells
1. Fill-out an appropriate plate map for each tissue sample in each well
1. Add 15 mL Digestion buffer to a 50 mL conical
1. Add 600 uL Proteinase K to 50 mL conical
1. Shake/invert gently
1. Add 150 uL of buffer + proteinase to each well of 96-well plate
1. Cap the plate and incubate at 55 C for 2-3 hours (may be reduced)
1. Visually inspect tissue to ensure it is digested
1. Place 80 uL of each digest into a clean plate for further processing
1. Retain the remaining 70 uL for long-term sample storage at -20 C

## Purification of DNA via MUD using 96-well plates ##

### Summary ###

We will use a high-throughput MUD (diatomaceous earth) + GuSCN procedure to purify DNA from 96-well plates

### Goal ###

Purify DNA from tissue

### Inputs ###

1. MUD
1. DNA binding buffer
2. Washing ethanol
2. Digested tissue (muscle, skin, blood) from animal(s) of interest

### Outputs ###

1. Purified DNA

### Detailed steps ###

1. Stack a clean Millipore plate on top of a clean, compatible (skirted) Fisher Plate.
1.  Vortex the MUD solution vigorously
1.  Pour ~ 5.0 mL into a V-bottom tray
1.  Place the V-bottom tray on the Plate Genie (or keep shaking) and add 30 µL of MUD to each well of the Millipore plate
1.  Pour the remaining MUD back into a conical
1.  Pour 15.0 mL of DNA binding buffer (GuSCN) into a V-bottom tray and add 135 uL to each well of the Millipore plate
1.  Add 40 uL of digested tissue to the Millipore plate
1.  Cover the Millipore Plate & let samples sit at 55 C and/or mix gently on the Plate Genie for 5+ minutes.
1. Centrifuge the Millipore plate + Fisher plate for 1 min. at 1,200 x g.  This will force the liquid into the Fisher plate.

1.  Cover & let samples mix gently on the Plate Genie for 2+ minutes.
1.  Centrifuge for 1 min. at 1,200 x g into the Fisher plate
1.  Repeat steps 10-12 (i.e., wash a 2nd time).  Ensure you spin long enough that ALL liquid has passed through!
1.  Empty collection plate or place Millipore plate over a new Fisher skirted plate
1.  Dry the Millipore plate for 5 to 20 m at 55 C or until it appears dry
1.  Add 50 uL TLE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM EDTA) to the Millipore plate, add cover and incubate plate for 5+ m at 55 C
1.  Centrifuge for 1 min. at 1,200 x g into a fresh recovery (skirted) plate!
1.  Discard the Millipore plate
1.  Cover & store the recovery plate (containing eluted DNA) at 4 C over the short-term or -20 C for longer term

## Chelex treatment of extracted DNA ##

### Summary ###

We can treat our extracted DNA with 10 % Chelex to "capture" impurities that may have made their way into the extracted DNA which is in solution.  Often, these impurities will inhibit the PCR reaction, occasionally keeping it from running successfully.  Chelex treatment is an easy and efficient way to remove many of the impurities and to increase amplification success.

### Goal ###

Remove impurities form extracted DNA with a solution of Chelex resin

### Inputs ###

1. Purified DNA from above in recovery plate
2. 10 % Chelex resin from above

### Outputs ###

1. Chelex-treated, purified DNA ready for PCR

### Detailed steps ###

1. Vortex 10% Chelex vigorously
1. Pour ~5 mL into a V-bottom tray
1. Place V-bottom tray on the Plate Genie (or keep shaking) 
1. Add 50 or 100 uL (1X or 2X dilution) 10% Chelex resin to each well of the recovery plate.
1. On a thermal-cycler, incubate the plate at 99.9 C for 10m, followed by a step at 15 C for 10m
1. Transfer the contents of the recovery plate to a clean Millipore Plate stacked on a new, compatible (skirted), Fisher plate
1.  Cap and spin the plate stack (with counterbalance) for 5m at 1,200 x g
1.  Discard the Milllipore plate
1.  Seal the clean DNA plate with 3M tape, and store at 4 C or -20 C

As described above, the above is largely derived from:

However, that relies upon the following references that are adapted from Boom et al. (1990), Höss & Pääbo (1993), Höss (1994), and Travis Glenn's older TSilicaDNA protocol (also available via the Internet).  Additional variations on this theme have also been developed.  Carter & Milton (1993) present a simpler protocol.  Höss et al. (1992) combined proteinase K digestions with silica extraction to get DNA from bear poop.  Gerloff et al. (1995) combined the methods of Carter & Milton with the Boom et al. (1990) and Höss & Pääbo (1993) to extract DNA from bonobo poop.  Constable et al. (1995) combined silica methods with CTAB and phenol extractions to get DNA from baboon poop.  So, as you can see, there are lots of variations that could be done.  Apparently working on poop is the key to getting a publication into Nature…
