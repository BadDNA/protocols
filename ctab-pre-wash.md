# Summary #

The following protocol is for a pre-wash step for problematic plant templates (e.g. leaves) that is to be used prior to CTAB extraction.  The pre-wash treatment derives from Li et al. 2007.

The pre-wash procedure helps deal with secondary plant compounds commonly found in plant leaves and other “non-soft” plant tissues.  These include polysaccharides, polyphenolics, and tannins.  2-mercaptoethanol, PVP, and CTAB help remove these compounds from solution such that they are not carried over into the extracted DNA used in PCR (which they then inhibit, making you sad).

PVP absorbs polyphenols in solution (the PVP then being removed by pipetting) while 2-mercaptoethanol (AKA β-mercaptoethanol) helps to break disulfide bonds (i,e. proteins).  CTAB, which is the other primary “ingredient” in the following protocol, binds polysaccharides, which are then removed from solution.

This protocol can be used in combination with [CTAB extraction](CTAB-DNA extraction-from-problematic-plant-materials) to give you the double-whammy leg-up on really problematic templates (note that the steps here are essentially identical to preliminary steps in the CTAB DNA extraction protocol).

## Pre-wash of plant material ##

### Summary ###

We will treat homogenized plant tissue or homogenize plant tissue with a pre-wash containg PVP and B-mercaptoethanol to reduce the level of PCR inhibitors in solution.

### Goal ###

To remove PCR inhibitors from homogenates of plants prior to CTAB extraction

### Inputs ###

1. Plant material or homogenize plant material

### Outputs ###

1. Pre-washed plant material ready for CTAB DNA extraction

### Detailed steps ###

1. Add plant tissue (10 - 20 mg) or plant tissue homogenates (e.g. from grinding) to a 1.5 or 2.0 mL microtube or deep-well plate
2. Mix the CTAB Pre-wash buffer with PVP and B-mercaptoethanol

    B-mercaptoethanol    |     4.5 uL    |     135.0 uL  |   450.0 uL    |

3. Add 1 mL of the Pre-wash buffer mix to each tube/well of a plate containing homogenates

4. [optional] Add beads to samples

5. Shake plates or tubes in a bead-mill if using beads or invert plates/tubes if using homogenates from grinding

6. Spin plates/tubes for 10 m at 10,000 RPM (or max for plate-centrifuge)

7. If using tubes, pour off supernatant.  If using plates, aspirate supernatant and remove to a HazMat container

8. Proceed directly to CTAB Extraction
