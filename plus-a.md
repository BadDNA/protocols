### Summary ###

After repairing the ends of the sheared fragments to make them blunt, we need to add a single Adenosine to the 3’ end of each DNA molecule.  This will: 1) increase the efficiency of our subsequent ligation reactions with adaptors and 2) inhibit DNA fragments from ligating to each other during the linker ligations.  

### Goal ###

To add a single A to the 3’ end of each DNA molecule. 

### Detailed Steps ###

1. Into the fragmented & blunt-ended DNA, add the following for a 50 μL reaction

    3.0 μL          | 10x NEB Buffer #2                         | (comes w/ Klenow)
    4.0 μL          | dATP (0.25 mM -> 33 μM final)             | NEB # N0440S
    2.0 μL          | dH2O                                      | Amresco # E476-100ML
    1.0 μL          | Klenow Fragment 3’->5’ exo-               | NEB # M0212
    ----            |                                           |
    20.0 μL         | DNA (from above)                          |

2. Mix by pipetting and pulse spin

3. Place in thermal cycler and run the program A-TAQ:

    * 1 cycle of 37 C for 30 m => 75 C for 20 m => hold at 15 C

4. [I don’t think we need to clean-up the sample here.  It should be fine to use immediately for the next step.]
