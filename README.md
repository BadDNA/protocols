This repository contains a number of protocols that we (the baddna group) use in our labs.  We've posted them here for others to use and  modify as they see fit.

## Credit ##

For protocols derived from those that are used in other laboratories, we've made every attempt to credit you at the top (and occasionally bottom) of each respective protocol with either a citation or an hyperlink to a current version of your protocol.  If you think that your lab should be cited or that your publication was overlooked and should be cited, please contact us via the email address at the top of each protocol and we will do our best to include the proper citation.

We think it is important to cite protocols that were responsible for the generation of particular ideas and from which we have drawn extensively.  Many protocols available on the internet do not provide these citations.

## Copyright ##

For data reproduced from tables of publications or for direct quotes from other publications, we have attempted to properly credit those sources.  We also believe that our use of data from these tables and/or direct quotations constitutes [http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html](fair use) of the previously published material.

## This is a work in progress... ##

We're in the process of adding items to this repository.  Shortly, we will also add information to the web-page for this project.  We've also got a number of additional ideas for this site (e.g. suggested equipment lists for beginning small, medium, large labs, etc.).
